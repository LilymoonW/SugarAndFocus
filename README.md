## 🐱 About

**Sugar** is a pixel-style cat I designed to make studying more fun and rewarding. Start a timer, stay focused, and earn coins to unlock adorable recipes! Each completed session lets you cook a virtual dish that gets added to your recipe book.

Designed with motivation in mind, this app combines productivity with pixel charm.
